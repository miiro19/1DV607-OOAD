The yacht club “The jolly pirate” has started to get problems. The club has grown to such an extent that the members have a hard time keeping track of all meetings, and other important dates such as the club’s various competitions. It is also difficult for a member to change information in the membership registry, for example change address or reporting that they have a newly purchased boat. The result of this is that members sometimes are without a reserved berth, when it became time for launch towards the spring.

The reservation of berths is operated by the club secretary and he goes through all members’ boats and book their berth in the spring. This is a very “tricky” work, members owning several boats would love to have them as close together as possible, while they want their “usual” place. Much fuss and mess usually follow the announcement of this year’s places, and sometimes even “private” exchanges between members occurs, which strongly opposed by the municipality for safety reasons.

The biggest problem, however, has the club’s treasurer, it is quite impossible for the treasurer to manage all subscriptions manually via receipts that members come in with when they paid their fees. The fee consists of a fixed part and a variable part, where the variable component is dependent on the number and the size of the boats. Several members probably slips through each year without paying a fee, the result of wich is that the club will soon go bankrupt.
